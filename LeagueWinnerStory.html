      <p>Thirty years of hurt came to an end for Liverpool when they were confirmed as Premier League champions on Thursday courtesy of second-placed Manchester City's 2-1 defeat by Chelsea.</p>
      <p> The result at Stamford Bridge means Liverpool have an unassailable 23-point lead over City with seven games left.</p>
      <p>Liverpool were last champions of England when they won the old First Division title in 1989-90 after which a decline in fortunes saw Manchester United and Arsenal, then Chelsea and Manchester City seize power. </p>
      <p>Inspirational manager Jurgen Klopp has rekindled the Anfield flame though and delivered the club's 19th top-flight title, one behind arch-rivals United's record of 20, after finishing runners-up to City in a thrilling race last season.</p>
      <p>As the Chelsea game moved into stoppage time at an empty stadium in London, 350km away outside Anfield Liverpool fans began lighting red flares as the celebrations began in earnest.</p>
      <p>Also watching from afar was an emotional Klopp.</p>
      <p>“I have no words, it's unbelievable and much more than I ever thought would be possible,” he told Sky Sports after being congratulated by Liverpool great Kenny Dalglish, manager of the 1989-90 title winners. “It's easy to motivate this team because of our great history. It's pure joy for me to coach them.”</p>
      <p>With 7 games left Liverpool has one the league with the most games remaining ever and they also won the League the latest that any team ever has with June 26th.</p>
